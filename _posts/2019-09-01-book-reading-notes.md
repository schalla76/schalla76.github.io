## Postioning

**Static, Relative, Absolute, Inhertance, Fixed.**

Static is default - normal document flow

Relative is relative to itself if directly under document otherwise relative to its parent. Relative still stays in the document flow.

Absolute is removed from document flow (i.e. that means for other elements this relative is not there in document).
And is relative to the first non static ancestor. If there is no non static ancestor then it is relative to the document.

The final piece of information to remember is that both relatively and absolutely positioned items wonâ€™t affect the static and fixed items around them (absolutely positioned items are removed from the flow, relatively positioned items occupy their original position).
