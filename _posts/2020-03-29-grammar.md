# Parsing based on grammar

## Steps for parsing

- Write a simple grammar
- Refine the grammar

  - Eliminate ambiguity. (If grammar leads to more than one parse tree for string then its ambiguous)
    - Ambiguity can be eliminated by adding left or right association rules, precedence rules.
      - Left association is achieved by left recursion.
      - Right association by right recursion.
      - Higher precedence is added by expanding the symbol later in the grammar.
  - Top down paring doesn't allow left recursion. To eliminate the left recursion use below formula.
  - Eliminate common prefixes (left factoring) or non deterministic grammar.

## Formula to eliminate lefte recursion

```cfg
Simple formula

Strings generated: βα*
A -> Aα|β

A -> βA'
A'-> αA'|ε

Generic formula
A -> Aα₁|Aα₂|Aα₃...|β₁|β₂|β₃

A -> β₁A'|β₂A'|β₃A'...
A'-> A'α₁|A'α₂|A'α₃...|ε
```

## Left factoring formula

```cfg
A'-> αA'
```

## Ambiguous grammar examples

```cfg
S->aS/Sa/a
S->aSbS/bSaS/ε
R->R+R/R*R/R*/a/b/c
```

## Left recursive grammar exmaples

```cfg
E->E+F|F
F->F*T|T
T->a|b|c
```

## Non deterministic grammar examples

The α symbol is repeating, so we can't decide until which rule to apply until we check the next symbol (β₁β₂,β₃)

```cfg
A -> αβ₁|αβ₂|αβ₃
```

To eliminate non deterministic (left factoring)

```cfg
A -> αA'
A'-> β₁|β₂|β₃
```
